## General Information
- This project aims to develop a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for accurately detecting melanoma and other oncological diseases from skin images.
- The business problem addressed is the early detection of melanoma, which is crucial for improving prognosis and reducing mortality rates associated with skin cancer.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## Conclusions
- The custom CNN model achieved high accuracy in detecting melanoma and other oncological diseases.
- Data augmentation techniques effectively addressed issues of overfitting and underfitting, improving model generalization.
- Class distribution analysis revealed class imbalances, which were rectified using the Augmentor library, leading to improved model performance.
- The final model demonstrated robustness in detecting melanoma, contributing to early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow - version 2.5
- Matplotlib - version 3.4
- Augmentor - version 0.2
